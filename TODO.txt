Modify UI (`feature-ui`) to accept filter params to return data in list/table
 - Maybe amplify/cognito if time
 - Add tests
Modify serverless
 - Add logging
 - Add error handling
 - Add events
    - APIGW -> SNS -> SQS -> DDB Trigger -> Lambda
    - Return data with websocket? that'd be fun
    - OR... just respond with data from DDB without all of that mess (but, should showcase event driven goodies)
